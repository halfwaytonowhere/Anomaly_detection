# Anomaly_detection
 
This project main assumption was to built anomaly detection model basing on autoencoders for sheet serverlogs3 which is from Keggle.
With my colleague we did detecting model for 1 column and we examined the most suspicious columns from the sheet. We put togheter our results and check whcich one was the most anomalous column.
